Data science: Direct marketing optimization 

Task: 
Use dummy data to maximize revenue from direct marketing campaigns. 

Data: 
For the analysis, several tables are available:
- Social-demographical data (age, gender, tenure in a bank) 
- Products owned + actual volumes (current account, saving account, mutual funds, overdraft, 
  credit card, consumer loan) 
- Inflow/outflow on C/A, aggregated card turnover (monthly average over past 3 months) 
- For 60 % of clients actual sales + revenues from these are available (training set) 

Conditions: 
- The bank has capacity to contact only 15 pct. of the clients (cca 100 people) with a marketing 
  offer and each client can be targeted only once. 

Proposed steps: 
- Create an analytical dataset (both training and targeting sets) 
- Develop 3 propensity models (consumer loan, credit card, mutual fund) using training data set 
- Optimize targeting clients with the direct marketing offer to maximize the revenue 

Expected result: 
- Which clients have higher propensity to buy consumer loan? 
- Which clients have higher propensity to buy credit card? 
- Which clients have higher propensity to buy mutual fund? 
- Which clients are to be targeted with which offer? General description. 
- What would be the expected revenue based on your strategy?
